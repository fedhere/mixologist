Bartender Giusepi Cipriani invented this cocktail at Harry's Bar, Venice in 1948. The drink was named after the 15th century Italian painter, Giovanni Bellini. It is reported that the pink glow of one of Bellini's painting is the inspiration to this cocktail. Originally this cocktail would only be made for four months of the year when the white peaches were in season. This was the case until Giusepi's son Arrigo began using a flash frozen peach purée. With the opening of Harry's Bar in New York City, the Bellini has been embraced throughout the western hemisphere.\n",

The effect is best achieved if it is poured over a spoon turned upside down over the top of the glass so that the liquid runs gently down the sides rather than splashing into the lower layer and mixing with it.

Dark rum is also preferable, since it is the mixing of the brown rum with the orange juice that produces the distinct brass-like coloration for which this drink is named. Much of this drink's notoriety comes from the Beastie Boys' song: \"Monkey tastes Def when you pour it on ice. Come on y'all it's time to get nice\". An alternative cocktail, often attributed to the Beastie Boys track, is essentially a variation on a mimosa. It consists of three parts malt liquor and one part Sunny Delight. Typically Olde English 800 or St Ides is used, and always in the forty-ounce bottle. The first quarter to third of the bottle is consumed, and then topped off with Sunny D, capped, inverted, and guzzled.\n",

      "       One lime (tip: get rid of white centre), 1-2 tsp (5-10 mL) sugar (to taste), cachaça (to fill glass containing lime, sugar, and ice). Cut the lime in four pieces and crush with sugar using a wooden pestle in a whiskey tumbler or similar glass. Add cachaça, stir, and finally add crushed or grained ice, or ice in cubes. The finer the ice, the faster it cools, but also dilutes the mixture. The amount of cachaça can vary from one to two doses, depending on the size of the glass. Although not an original procedure, water may be added to dilute, but it is normally not necessary as the ice will melt. Shake vigorously. Caipirinha is a traditional Brazilian drink. If you don't have cachaça on hand, replace with a good quality clear rum (in this case, the drink is called a \"caipiríssima\"), or vodka can also be used (\"caipiroska\"). In Europe, it is fashionable to use brown sugar instead of white, giving the drink a mossy colour and an earthy, warmer feel to it. Some bartenders use simple syrup in order to minimise the mixing needed and crunchiness of sugar crystals. Some people also replace the ice cubes with chopped ice, but this causes it to melt more quickly, watering down the drink. Some health-conscious Brazilians will drink it with a sugar substitute such as aspartame. A \"caipifruta\" is prepared in the same way, replacing or complementing the lime with any other fruit (always fresh, never juices). Popular fruits include passion fruit, kiwi, lemon, pineapple and strawberry. A caipirinha should be drunk quickly, as the essential oils of the lime peel, set free while pounding the lime halves, will give an unpleasant, bitter taste\n",

Some mixing in the middle is fine (and even desirable) but at the top it should be all tequila. Light the tequila with a lighter, and allow the blue flame to burn. It helps to use the lighter on the side of the glass too, to warm up all of the liquid. Works best in a tall shot glass. When the flame starts to taper off (or when you can't hold yourself back any longer, or when you think it's good and hot) suck up all of it through a straw as quickly as possible.\n",

      "       This refers to a family of cocktails. Daiquirí Natural is the basic mix, that serves as the starting point to the more complex cocktails of the family: 1.3 oz (40 mL) light-dry rum, 0.7 oz (20 mL) lime juice, 1 teaspoon (5 mL) sugar, crushed ice. Mix the ingredients in a shaker and serve. Daiquiri Floridita is the most common and famous version of this cocktail, allegedly it was invented by Constantino Ribalaigua Vert, barman and owner of the Floridita in the 1950s, whom Ernest Hemingway nicknamed El grande Constante. This recipe is also known as Daiquirí Frappé: 1.5 oz (45 mL) light-dry rum, the juice of 1 lime, 1 tsp (5 mL) sugar, crushed ice, 10 drops of maraschino liqueur. Mix all the ingredients in a blender until the ice is finely crushed and serve iced. Strawberry Daiquiri: ½ oz (15 mL) strawberry schnapps, 1 oz (30 mL) light rum, 1 oz (30 mL) lime juice, 1 tsp (5 mL) powdered sugar, 1 oz (30 mL) strawberries, crushed ice. Mix all the ingredients in a blender until the ice is finely crushed and serve iced. Other versions: Papa's is the version of the cocktail that Hemingway allegedly preferred (Papa is the nickname that fishermen gave Hemingway in Cuba), is identical to the Floridita Daiquiri, it only substitutes lime juice with grapefruit juice. It is said that Hemingway drank this cocktail with no sugar and doubled the rum. Mulata is the same cocktail as the Floridita Daiquiri, but instead of light-dry rum (which is colourless) it requires aged rum, which gives the cocktail an amber colour. Other versions, which did not originate in the Floridita, are also common in bars worldwide, such as Banana daiquiri and Strawberry daiquiri.\n",

Other ingredients include spices such as nutmeg, cinnamon, coriander or allspice. Eggnog is typically served as a winter drink.

Strain into a chilled Martini glass. The Hanky-Panky cocktail was the brainchild of Ada Coleman. Her benefactor, Rupert D'Oyly Carte, a member of the D'Oyly Carte family that first produced Gilbert and Sullivan operas in London, and the family that built the Savoy Hotel. When Rupert became chairman of the Savoy in 1903, Ada was given a position at the hotel's American Bar, where she eventually became the head bartender and made cocktails for the likes of Mark Twain, the Prince of Wales, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden and Sir Charles Hawtrey. Charles Hawtrey was the man for whom \"Coley\", as Ada Coleman was affectionately called, created the Hanky-Panky cocktail. He was an Victorian and Edwardian actor who mentored Noel Coward. Coley herself told the story behind the creation of the Hanky-Panky to England's The People newspaper in 1925:\n",

Give me something with a bit of punch in it.' It was for him that I spent hours experimenting until I had invented a new cocktail. The next time he came in, I told him I had a new drink for him. He sipped it, and, draining the glass, he said, 'By Jove! That is the real hanky-panky!' And Hanky-Panky it has been called ever since.\"\n",

      "       Ice cubes, 2 measures (60 mL) vodka, 2/3 measure (20 mL) Galliano, 5 measures (150 mL) orange juice, 1 slice of orange. Half-fill the shaker with ice cubes. Add the vodka and orange juice, and shake well. Strain into an ice-filled highball glass. Gently float the Galliano on top, and garnish with the orange slice. This well known tipple was one of many cocktails invented by renowned, (and two times world champion) mixologist Donato 'Duke' Antone (other notable 'Duke' creations are the Rusty Nail, The Godfather and the Flaming Caesar). This is one of many cocktails invented by 'Duke' in Los Angeles during the 1950's. According to legend, Harvey was actually a Californian surfer. After losing an important contest, he consoled himself in Duke's Blackwatch bar with one of his 'special' screwdriver cocktails, (a screwdriver with a dash of Galliano liqueur). After several drinks, he tried to leave the bar, but unfortunately kept bumping into the furniture and walls. Harvey 'the Wallbanger' became his nickname and the famous drink was named. In 2005, the American-based Food Network listed the Harvey Wallbanger cocktail as number four in its list of the top five fad foods of the 1970s.\n",

The Irish rootbeer float is a relatively new invention, finding its origins in the Southwestern region of Pennsylvania. It is a creamy, sweet beverage that utilises the mild neutral flavour of vodka to excellent effect, having a deceptively high alcohol content. The mix itself is very simple and versatile. Many feel that an Irish rootbeer float can act as a better introduction to spirits than beer, which is a far more common introduction to alcoholic beverages. The recipe is not written in stone, and the ratio may be adjusted to taste without compromising the overall flavour of the beverage. The Even-more Irish Rootbeer Float is a variation in which some, or all of the vodka is substituted with whiskey. Whilst a minor variation, it does result in a definitively different drink. The flavour is richer and more caustic and far less conducive to first-time drinkers. It does stay truer to its namesake, however. It comprises: 1 part rootbeer, 1 part Bailey's Irish Cream, 1 part whiskey (or a mixture of some part whiskey, some part vodka).\n",

These condiment containers can be purchased in bulk, and come with lids to prevent alcohol evaporation. A jello shot is made just like regular gelatin desserts. Half of the total water required by the recipe is boiled, and then the mix is dissolved into the water. The remaining half of the water is replaced with liquor.

Trader Vic's amicable rival, Don the Beachcomber, claimed to have created it first in 1933 at his own newly opened little bar (later a famous restaurant) in Hollywood. The Beachcomber's recipe is far more complicated than that of the Trader's and tastes quite different. Maitai is the Tahitian word for \"good\". The Trader Vic story of its invention is that the Trader (Victor J. Bergeron) created it one afternoon for some friends who were visiting from Tahiti. One of them tasted it and cried out: \"Maitai roa!\" (\"Very good!\") Hence the name. The first three of the following Maitai recipes are provided by Trader Vic's to\n",

Add a sprig of fresh mint. Recipe 2: \"Old Way\" Trader Vic Maitai Formula - 1997: 1 oz (30 mL) Fine Jamaican rum (15 or 8 year old), 1 oz (30 mL) Martinique rum (St. James), ½ oz (15 mL) Orange Curaçao, ½ ounce (15 mL) Orgeat Syrup, juice from one fresh lime (about ¾ oz[20 mL]).

Shake all the ingredients in a shaker with ice and strain into an old fashioned glass over crushed ice. Garnish with fruits and serve with a straw. Recipe 4: Don the Beachcomber Maitai: This version is much closer to what Don the Beachcomber served in his restaurants. It can be garnished with various fruits, as in the above recipe. Falernum, which is now difficult to obtain in the United States except from a single supplier in Seattle, is a flavored Caribbean syrup with a very different taste from the Orgeat syrup used in the Maitai 1. Ingredients: 2 oz (60 mL) water, ¾ oz (20 mL) fresh lime juice, 1 oz (30 mL) fresh grapefruit juice, 1 oz (30 mL) sugar syrup, 1 oz (30 mL) dark rum, 1½ oz (20 mL) golden rum, ½ oz (15 mL) Cointreau or triple sec, ¼ oz (7.5 mL) Falernum syrup, 2 dashes or scant ½ tsp Angostura bitters, 1 dash or scant ¼ tsp Pernod or other anisette-flavoured pastis. Shake all the ingredients in a shaker with ice and strain into a tall highball glass filled with crushed ice. Garnish with fruits and serve with a straw. Recipe 5: Pineapple Variation Maitai: 4 oz (120 mL) orange juice, 4 oz (120 mL) pineapple juice, 1 oz (30 mL) lime juice, 1 oz (30 mL) dark rum, 1 oz (30 mL) light rum, 1 oz (30 mL) triple sec, ½ oz (15 mL) grenadine.\n",

Melted ice will bring the liquid content up to 3 oz (90 mL) total. Prepare as a stirred cocktail. Mixing a Martini is a trying task, as it is difficult to measure out just enough vermouth. Harvard suggests using a metal shaker and rimming the full edge with the liquid. This means pouring in enough that the liquid coats the bottom of the shaker, but doesn't start to fill it. A dry Martini can be made by rimming half the shaker, leaving part of the bottom untouched by vermouth; and an extra dry Martini is done by splashing a little vermoth in the shaker, swirling it around, and dumping it back out before adding the gin.

This recipe is in the San Luis Potosí/Cuernavaca style: 355 mL beer (any kind will do), 120 mL Clamato (Clam-Tomato cocktail; optional, but highly recommended), 1 or 2 lemons, Worcestershire Sauce, maggi juice, Black-Label Valentina Sauce (hard to get for people outside of Mexico), salt, pepper, chilled beer mug, ice. Have a beer mug chilled, then frost it with salt and lemon. Pour in about 25 to 35 mL of Valentina Sauce. Squeeze in your lemons. Add some Worcestershire sauce, then the Maggi juice. Now, salt and pepper to taste, then stir. Add your 120 mL of Clamato, then keep stirring. Finally, pour in your beer while you keep stirring. Add some ice if you like. There's no secret for mixing the best Michelada, it must suit your taste. If you want to make liter-sized Micheladas, you need to vary proportionally the quantity of ingredients shown in this table. But then again, it must please you. It's some sort of acquired taste. You must not replace the Valentina sauce with some other kind of sauce (say, Tabasco). It won't taste the same.\n",

It is a variation of the traditional mojito that substitutes the lime with blueberries and blackberries, and regular clear rum with vanilla flavor rum. 4-6 blueberries, 4-6 blackberries, 6-9 mint leaves (optional), sugar (optional), 1 part vanilla flavored rum, 3 parts club soda, and 3-4 raspberries. Place the blueberries and blackberries into a shaker, muddle them well with a pestle, add the vanilla rum and fill the shaker with ice, then shake well (up to 30 times). Afterwards, pour it through a strainer (to filter out the berry skins) into a tall ice filled glass, top it with the club soda, stir and garnish with raspberries. Mint leaves can be added for a more traditional mojito flavor and sugar for extra sweetness.\n",

It was named after Count Camillo Negroni, the man who invented it by asking a bartender to add gin to the Americano, his favourite drink. However, the word Negroni doesn't appear in English cocktail guides before 1947, so the drink's true origins are uncertain.

Before drinking, add one cinnamon ball, the type found in bags of bulk candy. You now have a One-Balled Dictator. A splash of Galliano liqueur added just before shaking will create a Mussolini. One-Balled Dictator is a wine cocktail drunk by World War II veterans. The name is seen by some as a little unorthodox, yet is still seen as a reasonably tasty drink. Symbolism: The combination of the milky-white liebfraumilch with the champagne will produce a very white drink, where the German very quickly overwhelms the French. The wide-mouthed rocks glass provides breathing room for the drink, which has only one ball. Taken together, this is clearly a joke reference to Adolf Hitler, who, after the invasion of Poland, took over France in a very successful and fast way, through the \"lightning war\" or blitzkrieg, during the early years of World War II. The reference to Hitler's \"one ball\" comes from the lyrics to a crude song sung by British soldiers, to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March. Although the symbolism renders this primarily a joke recipe, the actual drink produced is unique and quite pleasant. The fiery taste of the cinnamon gives an interesting contrast to the \"cooler\" flavour of the white wines. This drink originated in Cincinnati, Ohio in the late 1940s, concocted by veteran members of the US 82nd Airborne Division.\n",

Stir as needed, then decorate with a lemon rind. Alternative: Instead of using silver tequila, you could use rested (reposado) variation. It gives a more \"wooden\" texture to the experience.

Romulan Ale is somewhat popular in collegiate circles, especially among fraternities that encourage drinking of very strong alcoholic beverages at social functions. It is named after the blue-coloured Star Trek series drink Romulan Ale, from the Romulan Empire, that is illegal in Federation-controlled territory, but oft consumed by Star Fleet officers when there is a call for a lightening of mood. Different recipes call for different spirits to be mixed, but generally the strongest of rum, vodka or pure grain alcohol, and blue-coloured orange-flavoured liqueurs are used.\n",

Remember, in a good sangria, there is never too much fruit. So, if in doubt, go for it. And in the end, ice is always a good idea so remember to buy it the day before and add it 10 or 15 minutes before the party starts. To prepare the sangria you'll need half a day or so, but the preparation shouldn't take more than an hour. Start by cutting all the fruits, pealing the citrics but leaving the apples skin on. Then pour all the wine in a container and all the fruits in with the wine. Add the sugar to taste (this would depend on how many fruits you had) and some cinnamon (be generous). Then leave to rest for 4-6 hours so that the wine soaks all the fruits and all the sugar dissolves well. Just before the party starts, add the rest of the liquids and ice.\n",

      "       The Sazerac is one of the oldest cocktails. The original recipe was developed by Antoine Peychaud (pay-show) in his New Orleans' French Quarter apothecary, circa 1820. Peychaud's drink was then popularised at a Coffee House in the French Quarter, called the Sazerac Coffee House. One version of the history says that the proprietor of the Sazerac Coffee House, was also the importer of Sazerac de Forge et fils (Sazerac &amp; Sons) Cognac. Over time, the recipe evolved from cognac to rye whiskey. Peychaud was developing his bitters as a curative for heart burn and indigestion, and added the cognac-absinthe concoction with sugar, to make it palatable. Even today, Peychaud's bitters mixed with club soda is a bartender's quick antidote for indigestion. Bitters and lemon is also used (by bartenders) to treat hiccoughs. Sazerac™ is often considered closest to the original recipe, however it is a trade secret.\n",

It was invented and popularised by Tucker Max as a way to quickly become inebriated. Variation: A variation of the Tucker Death Mix that appears in drinksmixer.com and freedrinkrecipes.com replaces 250 mL of grain alcohol with a second can of Red Bull, substituting alcohol content for flavour and caffeine. The volume produced is still the same but the alcoholic content is reduced to 32.4% (65 proof). Note: drinksmixer.com has the alternative composition listed as being 59 proof, which is presumably a miscalculation. The origins of the alternative composition of TDM are not known; however, it is worth noting that since Tucker Max was the eponymous originator of the beverage, the original proportions with higher alcohol content appearing on his website should be technically considered more correct.\n",

Cut the lime in four pieces and crush with sugar using a wooden pestle in a whiskey tumbler or similar glass. Add cachaça, stir, and finally add crushed or grained ice, or ice in cubes. The finer the ice, the faster it cools, but also dilutes the mixture. The amount of cachaça can vary from one to two doses, depending on the size of the glass. Although not an original procedure, water may be added to dilute, but it is normally not necessary as the ice will melt. Shake vigorously. Caipirinha is a traditional Brazilian drink. If you don\\'t have cachaça on hand, replace with a good quality clear rum (in this case, the drink is called a \"caipiríssima\"), or vodka can also be used (\"caipiroska\"). In Europe, it is fashionable to use brown sugar instead of white, giving the drink a mossy colour and an earthy, warmer feel to it. Some bartenders use simple syrup in order to minimise the mixing needed and crunchiness of sugar crystals. Some people also replace the ice cubes with chopped ice, but this causes it to melt more quickly, watering down the drink. Some health-conscious Brazilians will drink it with a sugar substitute such as aspartame. A \"caipifruta\" is prepared in the same way, replacing or complementing the lime with any other fruit (always fresh, never juices). Popular fruits include passion fruit, kiwi, lemon, pineapple and strawberry. A caipirinha should be drunk quickly, as the essential oils of the lime peel, set free while pounding the lime halves, will give an unpleasant, bitter taste'] \n",

A dry Martini can be made by rimming half the shaker, leaving part of the bottom untouched by vermouth; and an extra dry Martini is done by splashing a little vermoth in the shaker, swirling it around, and dumping it back out before adding the gin.

Before drinking, add one cinnamon ball, the type found in bags of bulk candy. You now have a One-Balled Dictator. A splash of Galliano liqueur added just before shaking will create a Mussolini. One-Balled Dictator is a wine cocktail drunk by World War II veterans. The name is seen by some as a little unorthodox, yet is still seen as a reasonably tasty drink. Symbolism: The combination of the milky-white liebfraumilch with the champagne will produce a very white drink, where the German very quickly overwhelms the French. The wide-mouthed rocks glass provides breathing room for the drink, which has only one ball. Taken together, this is clearly a joke reference to Adolf Hitler, who, after the invasion of Poland, took over France in a very successful and fast way, through the \"lightning war\" or blitzkrieg, during the early years of World War II. The reference to Hitler\\'s \"one ball\" comes from the lyrics to a crude song sung by British soldiers, to the tune of the Colonel Bogey March. Although the symbolism renders this primarily a joke recipe, the actual drink produced is unique and quite pleasant. The fiery taste of the cinnamon gives an interesting contrast to the \"cooler\" flavour of the white wines.
